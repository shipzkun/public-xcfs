  - According to [Wikipedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20220604094821/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_goose#Reproduction), this is a gander, so I'm going off of that. [The internet says](https://petkeen.com/male-vs-female-canada-goose/) [that male and female Canada Geese](https://animals.mom.com/tell-difference-between-female-male-canada-geese-7649.html) [look virtually identical](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-tell-the-difference-between-a-male-and-a-female-Canada-Goose).

All I did is remove the background and retain the birds themselves.
